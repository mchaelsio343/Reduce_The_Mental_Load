****** How to Execute ******
****************************
To run the application, run the following command:

node server.js

*********** Note ***********
****************************
Note that the website will be running on the port 5624 by default.
The port number can be changed in the server.js file.

Since the database is set up on the OSU flip server,
one has to connect to OSU internal network (ex: VPN) before
accessing the website.
